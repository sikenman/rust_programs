# My Rust Programs
I have created some simple sample Rust programs to demonstrate and utilize many features of the Rust programming language. Anybody can learn Rust by going through the sample codes.
## Programs
* Area of the Cricle
* Array in Rust
* ASCII characters (from 32 to 255; but leaving 127 to 160)
* Common elements in two array (normal)
* Common elements in two array (optimized using HashSet)
* Data types in Rust
* Division by Zero
* Enum in Rust
* Finding Weekday of Weekend
* Maximum and minium number in the array

* MegaBall Generator (10 set)
* Multiplication table of 7, 10 and 13
* PowerBall Generator (10 set)
* RGB color to Hexadecimal color
* Regular Expression pattern matching
* Reverse the string
* Student structure (StudID,...)
* To-Do list (console based)
* Triangle star pattern (increasing/decreasing & combined)
* Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan, ln)
